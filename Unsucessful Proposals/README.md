# 🗃️ Unsuccessful GSoC Proposals

Welcome to the `Unsuccessful Proposals/` folder of CodeArena Club's GSoC repository.  
This space is dedicated to proposals from our members/college students that, despite not getting selected, represent **real effort, learning, and commitment** to open source.

## 💡 Why This Folder?

Not every great proposal makes it to GSoC — and that’s okay.

This folder serves to:
- Showcase our club members' dedication and contributions.
- Help future applicants learn from real, detailed proposals.
- Normalize rejection as part of the journey.
- Keep the momentum going beyond GSoC.

## 📂 What's Inside?

Each folder contains:
- The full proposal PDF or Markdown.
- Context on the organization and project idea.
- Pre-GSoC contributions (if any).
- Reflections or lessons learned (optional but encouraged).

## 🚀 Next Steps

Being here is **not the end** — it’s a milestone.
- Continue contributing to your project (many unselected projects remain active!).
- Use the experience to reapply next year, or apply to other programs.
- Mentor others in the club who are applying — your experience is gold.

## 🧠 Tip for Future Contributors

Reading these will help you:
- Understand how proposals are structured.
- Avoid common pitfalls.
- Get ideas for framing your own project next year.
- Yuo can always contact them.
