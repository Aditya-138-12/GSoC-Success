# 📁 GSoC 2025 Unsuccessful Proposals

Welcome to the `2025/` folder containing proposals from CodeArena Club members that were not selected for Google Summer of Code 2025.  
These entries are still a source of learning, growth, and inspiration — and may continue evolving into real-world contributions.

**Serial No**: 1  
**Student**: Aditya Saroha  
**Organization**: CERN-HSF  
**Project**: Extending the User Interface for the Constellation Project  
**Proposal**: GSoC 2025 Project Proposal for Extending User Interface_ Constellation.pdf

#### 🏗️ Context
Constellation is a visualization tool used within CERN's HEP software ecosystem, but mainly its developed by the DESY. This project aimed to revamp and extend its front-end capabilities to support modular plug-in development and enhance usability for large datasets
Actually to setup the Constellation's modules such as Obversatory and GRAFANA based ecosystems, it would take a long time maybe weeks to even learn to setup by let us say new undergraduate Physics student, so the goal of the project was to provide visualizations on the fly!.

#### 🔧 Pre-GSoC Contributions made durinng the Proposal Submission period ;-)
- Fixed issue [#212](https://gitlab.desy.de/constellation/constellation/-/issues/212), [Github PR](https://github.com/constellation-daq/Constellation/pull/3)
- Fixed(On going) Docs Related Issue [Github PR](https://github.com/constellation-daq/Constellation/pull/5)

#### 💭 Reflections
Despite the rejection, the proposal writing process deepened my understanding of both the codebase and broader architectural goals. I plan to continue contributing to Constellation and reapply next year with a stronger case — and potentially mentor future applicants from the club.
Well actually the project unfortunately didn't got any slots from the Google.
