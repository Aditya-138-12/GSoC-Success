# GSoC Accepted Proposals 

This repository serves as an archive of [GSoC - Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) accepted/rejected proposals of SJCIT and other students from all over the world. GSoC is an Free and Open Source programme and CodeArena Club highly encourages the students to contribute to Open Source.

# Further Plans

The plan for now is to gather as much sucessfull and non-sucessfull proposals we can, with proper context and story of the applicant.
